# Month of Julia

Julia is a platform for applying Functional Programming principles to statistical and scientific problems. R is still
my preferred tool for day to day analytical tasks but I can see that I will be dabbling more and more with Julia in
the future.

I'll apologise in advance that I have been sloppy in places and sometimes used the incorrect nomenclature. For
instances, talking about "methods" when I should have said "functions", or "class" when I should have said "type".
I trust that the intent will still be clear.
